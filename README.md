# WiFi Controlled RC Car

Welcome to the WiFi Controlled RC Car project repository! This project enables wireless control of an RC car using a mobile application. The car is powered by a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller and controlled via commands sent over a WiFi network.It was developed as part of the (Team i5 â€“ IoT and Embedded Systems) Intel OneAPI Student Club at USAR, GGSIPU.

## Components Used
- **NodeMCU ESP8266**
- **2 L298N Motor Drivers**
- **1 12V Battery**
- **1 Mini Breadboard**
- **4 Johnson Motors**
- **1 Car Chassis**

## Software
- **Arduino IDE**: Used for writing, compiling, and uploading code to the NodeMCU ESP8266.
  - Libraries used:
    - `ESP8266WiFi.h`: Enables WiFi connectivity for the NodeMCU.
    - `WiFiClient.h`: Provides methods for TCP and UDP communication.
    - `ESP8266WebServer.h`: Allows creating a web server on the NodeMCU for handling HTTP requests.

## Project Structure
- **Code**: Arduino code responsible for receiving commands over WiFi and controlling the motors accordingly.
- **Project Photographs**: Images showing the setup of the RC car components and circuit.
